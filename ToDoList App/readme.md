## Test Instructions

Objective: Create a simple to-do list application.

Requirements:

The application should have an input field where the user can type a new to-do item.
There should be an "Add" button to add the new to-do item to the list.
Each to-do item in the list should have a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
The list should be displayed dynamically as items are added or removed.
Use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
Bonus Points:

Allow marking items as completed by clicking on them, which should change the appearance of the item (e.g., strikethrough text).
Use local storage to save the to-do list so that it persists across page reloads.
